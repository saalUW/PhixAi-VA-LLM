# msca_example

The python code in msca_example was the main file used in my Capston project: Integrating Large Language Models in Verbal Autopsy Workflows.
It uses the transformer platform for model management and can be run on CUDA enabled torch installations. This version of the code uses a CLI for model selection and auto detects files in path with the idea of being more user friendly to lay users.
